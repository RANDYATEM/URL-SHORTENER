#SERVERLESS URL-SHORTENER

Although several Url shortener such as tiny.cc, bit.ly etc already exist, having your own custom URL shortener is always handy when you want to share longer URLs(for example urls gotten from s3 buckets), and with Serverless, building and deploying applications has never been so easy, simple and quick.
